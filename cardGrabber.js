    cardGrabber.js helps the programmers take cards and insert them into the website.

    A large part of our problems when implementing the other features, is the management of HTML with our card objects.
    cardGrabber.js takes .html files from /Noted/Cards/ and can insert them into index.html.

    Using the object and emebed tags, we can easily place HTML within HTML without hassle:

    The difficulty is handling the passing of data between the cards, which is thankfully handled synchronously without the use of AJAX.
